I am an Embedded Software Engineer for Texas Instruments Incorporated in San
Diego California.  I'm currently working on integrating the OpenThread stack
within the SimpleLink ecosystem.

I was born and raised in Cedar Falls Iowa. I went to Iowa State University for
Computer Engineering. I received a Bachelors of Science in Computer Engineering
with a focus in Embedded Systems and Networking and a Minor in Mathematics.
After Graduating I was hired by Texas Instruments, and moved to San Diego
California.

I am interested in building great embedded software solutions for low power
wireless mesh networks.
